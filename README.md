Research notes and placeholders for a constraint-based control architecture governing admission, termination, and bounded reasoning in AI systems
# Constraint-Based Reasoning Control System

This repository accompanies ongoing research into architectures for controlling
automated reasoning systems under ambiguity, safety constraints, and insufficient
information.

## Overview

Most AI systems focus on generating answers. This work focuses on a different
problem: deciding **whether** a system should respond at all.

The research explores control-oriented architectures that separate:
- admission and routing decisions
- reasoning execution
- termination and escalation

The objective is bounded, deterministic behavior rather than maximal generation.

## Scope

This repository intentionally does **not** contain:
- implementation code
- algorithms or thresholds
- architectural diagrams
- validation results

Those details are excluded by design.

## Status

A provisional patent covering core architectural concepts has been filed.
This repository currently serves as a placeholder for future publications,
experiments, and reference material.

## Notes

Content may be added incrementally over time as research progresses.
